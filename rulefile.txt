## Test Rule File
## This is just a simple rule to demonstrate functionality,
## there will be many more complex rules later


## This rule will need to be derived
IF DanTracyIsAwesome THEN ThisIsAllGood;

## This rule will not be able to be proven
IF nonDerivable THEN unreachable();

IF rightIsOpen THEN moveRight();

IF leftIsOpen THEN moveLeft();

IF downIsOpen THEN moveDown();

IF upIsOpen THEN moveUp();

## This rule is malformed
IF leftIsOpen AND rightIsOpen OR THEN moveLeft()

## This will be called to prove the first rule
IF checkSurroundings() THEN DanTracyIsAwesome;
